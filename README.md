# sb-trial
Hi there! Welcome to one of the firmware trial task of SOUNDBOKS

## Task overview
This repository has a very minimal implementation of an application with a `main` entry point and an empty `timer` module. In short, the idea is to finish the code with the following specifications and we would not expect you to spend more than 4 hours on the task:

@TODO:
- Write a timer library/module that takes a pointer to a callback that will be called after a certain amount of time with a potentially specified context
- Intented to run on PIC32 - https://www.microchip.com/en-us/product/PIC32MX470F512H
- Should be a standalone module
- Use git in the development flow
- Static allocation only
- Send us a link to your git repository when you are done
